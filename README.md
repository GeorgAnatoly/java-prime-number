# Prime Number
This is a Java console program solution to the *Prime Number* practice problem,
found **here**: [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/basic-programming/input-output/basics-of-input-output/practice-problems/algorithm/prime-number-8/).

#### Problem:
Given an integer *n* print the series of primes through *n*.

###### Requirements:
  * Get user input
  * Check user input is a single number
  * Calculate the set of primes up to and including user input
  * Print series of primes through number to output
  
###### Constraints:
  * User may only enter a single number
  * User input must be 1000 >= *n* >= 1
  * Outputs a single line
  * Output has a single space separating digits
